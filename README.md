# Group_assign
Assign Tasks to Groups

# Features and usage
* A task can have an assigned group.
* If a user is in a group that a task is assigned to, it will show up on their dashboard.
* using ``assignee:me`` in filter will find tasks assigned to groups that the user is in.
* using ``assignee:'GroupName'`` in filter will find tasks assigned to a group by NAME of the group.
* using ``assignee:`GroupID'`` in filter will find tasks assigned to a group by ID number of group.
* using ``assignee:'Username'`` or ``assignee:'Name'`` will NOT find a task assigned to a group with that UserName or Name in the group, sorry...someone else can figure that one out. Just need to build the relationship. Maybe a future update I will add it.
